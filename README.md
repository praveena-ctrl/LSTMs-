# LSTMs-
This project presents a high-performance LSTM-based deep learning model designed to forecast future temperature trends using the Jena Climate dataset. By leveraging the strength of Long Short-Term Memory networks, the model captures long-range temporal dependencies, learns complex climate patterns, and delivers highly accurate next-step prediction.
